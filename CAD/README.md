This folder is for CAD documents and step files. Their is no reason to have the individual parts when there is an assembled version available, so I have only included the main assembly as well as specific toolheads. Check out the STLs folder for the individual 3D printed parts.

Also, for the sake of Github some files have been compressed.

To view the entire CAD design, checkout the latest [Onshape document](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1de0655c0501c319c0be82e5/w/00a76129439a8316e13df1dd/e/f03e8779d1a8cc2741025c01).
