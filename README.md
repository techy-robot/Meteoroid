# Meteoroid
Production-ready 3d printer based on a Ender 5 frame, with multifunction tool changing, bed changing, and accessories with robots.

It is desktop machine with plug and play heads and beds. Chain these machines together and add robot carriages in between and you got yourself an awesome modular factory that can fit on a bench. The cost of the _entire system_ will likely be several thousand dollars, with the main machine between $300 to $600. I aim to lower the cost of a complete industrial system as much as possible.

The base machine is a CoreXY printer with a 500+mm/s move speed 30k+ accel, and 4 tool changer slots. The printer is partially enclosed, with several openings for robots to quick swap tools and beds and sometimes even sub-tools (Like a pnp head with different nozzle sizes). Software-wise, it will be running Klipper, which can interface with other software like OpenPNP using macros and linux ports.
