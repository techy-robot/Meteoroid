Production-ready 3d printer based on a Ender 5 frame, with multifunction tool changing, bed changing, and accessories with robots.

It is desktop machine with plug and play heads and beds. Chain these machines together and add robot carriages in between and you got yourself an awesome modular factory that can fit on a bench. The cost of the _entire system_ will likely be several thousand dollars, with the main machine between $300 to $500. I aim to lower the cost of a complete industrial system as much as possible.

The base machine is a CoreXY printer with a 500+mm/s move speed 30k+ accel, and 4 tool changer slots. The printer is partially enclosed, with several openings for robots to quick swap tools and beds and sometimes even sub-tools (Like a PnP head with different nozzle sizes). Software-wise, it will be running Klipper, which can interface with other software like OpenPNP using macros and linux ports.

Goals/Requirements:
- Standard 235mm x 235mm heated bed size with Garolyte bed for easy print release, supported by dual z-axis motors to provide stabilty without the complexity of an automatic leveling trimotor bed.
- Klipper
- Tool changer with 4 slots
- CoreXY
- Medium cost for a desktop production system
- Completely Open-Source
- 3 Accessory slots for extra toolhead elements like PnP heads or a camera
- Off-the-shelf components that are well known and high-quality, with many parts 3D printed in ABS
- Enclosed
- High speed 500mm/s and 30k accel
- High Quality

Total Aggrigate Hours Spent: 14 hrs
